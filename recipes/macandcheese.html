    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="images/mac.jpg">
    <p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>
    <ul>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</ul>
    <ul>2 ½ cups milk</ul>
    <ul>2 cups water</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon garlic salt</ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon salt</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup margarine</ul>
    <ul>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
    <ul>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</ul>
    <ul>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup real bacon bits</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon snipped chives</ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</p>
